Description: Browser based retro style arcade game inspired by the classic Frogger where instead of having to dodge cars as a frog, you must run over as many frogs as possible (as they're an invasive species in this game) while not hitting other cars and avoiding the police.

Simply download audio and images directories along with revfrog.html and revfrog2.js, and open the HTML file to play the game.
