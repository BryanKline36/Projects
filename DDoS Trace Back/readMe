As a makefile is used, in order to compile the following command is used:

    make

To run to program:

    ./HW1

This will prompt the user to manually input the topolpgy, alternatively one of the configuration files can be used
by redirecting it into the program:

    ./HW1 < network_1.txt

This will build the topology, run the attack simulation, and produce a file called output.txt containing the
results of the attack, in order to specify a different name:

    ./HW1 newOutput.txt < network_1.txt
